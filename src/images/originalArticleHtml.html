    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
        <span class="s7">The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine&#39;s Third Practice Advisory on
            local anesthetic systemic toxicity is an interim update from its 2010 advisory. The advisory focuses on new
            information regarding the mechanisms of lipid resuscitation, updated frequency estimates, the preventative
            role of ultrasound guidance, changes to case presentation patterns, and limited information related to local
            infiltration anesthesia and liposomal bupivacaine. In addition to emerging information, the advisory updates

            toxicity.</span>

    <p><strong>What's New in This Update?</strong></p>
    <p> <span class="s7">This interim update summarizes recent scientific findings that have
            enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to lipid emulsion reversal of LAST, including rapid
            partitioning, direct inotropy, and post-conditioning. Since the previous practice advisory, epidemiological
            data have emerged that suggest a lower frequency of LAST as reported by single institutions and some
            registries, nevertheless a considerable number of events still occur within the general community.
            Contemporary case reports suggest a trend toward delayed presentation, which may mirror the increased use of
            ultrasound guidance (fewer intravascular injections), local infiltration techniques (slower systemic
            uptake), and continuous local anesthetic infusions. Small patient size and sarcopenia are additional factors
            that increase potential risk for LAST. An increasing number of reported events occur outside of the
            traditional hospital setting and involve non-anesthesiologists.</span></p>

    <p>Interventions involving local anesthetics are
        ubiquitous throughout medicine and are performed by anesthesiologists, other physicians, dentists, and
        paramedical personnel. Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) remains a serious adverse event despite
        advances in prevention, detection, and treatment. Such events range across a continuum from mild subjective
        prodromal symptoms to seizure, cardiac arrest, and/or death. As noted in our previous</p>

    <p><span class="p">The American Society
            of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) convened its first Conference on Local Anesthetic Toxicity
            in 2001 coinciding with initial clinical experience after release of the levo-enantiomers ropivacaine and
            l-bupivacaine, plus emerging laboratory observations on the effectiveness of lipid emulsion as an antidote
            for LAST. In 2008, a second advisory panel met to develop a rational approach for treatment</span>2<span
            class="p"> and to assimilate information on the history, mechanisms, prevention, and detection of
            LAST.</span>1,3<span class="s17">–</span>7<span class="p"> Consistent with ASRA&#39;s commitment to update
            its practice advisories as new knowledge emerges, in 2015, the board of directors commissioned a small group
            of current researchers to develop this third advisory. In compliance with calls from medical journal editors
            to focus practice advisory updates on new information,</span>8<span class="p"> we herein present developing
            knowledge on the mechanisms of lipid resuscitation, new insights into incidence and epidemiology, evolving
            patterns of case presentation, and revised treatment protocols.</span></p>
    <p><span class="p">This executive
            summary condenses information and recommendations from supporting articles that have been published
            recently</span>9<span class="p"> or concurrently as part of this practice advisory.</span>10<span
            class="s17">–</span>13<span class="p"> Practitioners are encouraged to read these articles to understand the
            basis underlying our recommendations.</span></p>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">METHODS</h2>
    <p>Individual supporting articles
        provide details relevant to the sources accessed to derive their analysis and recommendations. In general,
        standard medical literature search engines and article cross-referencing were used to identify animal and human
        studies, case reports and series, and epidemiologic information. The focus was on new publications and
        developments since our 2010 advisory. The panel consisted of recognized experts in LAST and/or guideline
        development and includes the authors of this article. The ASRA provided standard travel reimbursement for
        members of the advisory group who met in Chicago on March 26, 2016. No panelist was paid for their
        participation, nor did ASRA receive</p>
    <p>external funds to support the
        advisory process.</p>

    <p>The second ASRA practice advisory sought input
        from external sources including other anesthesiologists with expertise in LAST, professional organizations
        representing physicians and dentists who commonly use local anesthetics, and open forum discussion of our
        recommendations.<span>1</span> Because the current practice advisory represents an interim update
        and does not recommend major changes to treatment, external input was solicited only at open forum presentations
        coinciding with the ASRA 2015 and 2016 spring meetings.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Strength of Recommendations</h2>
    <p>As stated in our 2010 advisory:
        <span>“</span>There are no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating serious human LAST; future
        RCTs are unlikely because of the rarity of these complications and the associated difficulty of obtaining
        informed consent for medical interventions in critical illness. Common strength-of-evidence schemas that are
        based on RCT-level evidence are therefore inappropriate for the topic of human LAST, but may be appropriate for
        animal studies. Hence, the panel&#39;s recommendations are based on a modified Classification of Recommendations
        and Levels of Evidence schema that was developed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart
        Association<span>14</span> (Table 1). The panel wishes to emphasize that assigning a level of
        evidence B or C should not be construed as implying that the associated recommendation is supported by
        conflicting data or is limited by conflicting interpretations of the available data. Rather, such
        recommendations reflect our recognition of the importance of the particular question as it relates to LAST and
        to the reality that the specific question is either yet to be addressed by an RCT or does not lend itself to
        experimental inquiry in humans.<span>”</span><span>1</span>
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Limitations</h2>
    <p>As with previous ASRA
        advisories, <span>“</span>readers of this manuscript are reminded that practice advisories are
        created when data on a subject are limited or non-existent. Advisories rely on limited clinical and animal data
        and, as such, the synthesis and interpretation of data by one group of experts may differ from conclusions by
        another set of equally qualified
        experts. Thus, practice advisories represent a level of recommendation less than that offered by standards or
        clinical practice guidelines. The recommendations contained herein do not define standard of care. They are not
        intended to replace clinical judgment as applied to a specific patient scenario. These recommendations are
        intended to encourage optimal patient care, but cannot ensure the avoidance of adverse outcomes. As with any
        practice advisory recommendation, these are subject to revision as knowledge of specific complications
        advances.<span>”</span>

    <h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
    <h2>Mechanisms Underlying Lipid Resuscitation</h2>
    <p>The most important recent
        advances in our knowledge of LAST relate to the basic science of lipid emulsion resuscitation, within both
        anesthesiology and other disciplines that involve medical toxicology. New to this practice advisory, Fettiplace
        and Weinberg<span>10</span> provide an in depth discussion of the mechanisms that underlie the
        therapeutic reversal of LAST by lipid emulsion. Henceforth, we summarize the most salient points of this topic,
        the complexity of which necessitates reading the accompanying supporting article to move beyond basic
        understanding.</p>
    <p>Lipid emulsion reversal of LAST is ultimately
        linked to cellular mechanisms that are affected by local anesthetics. Under normal circumstances, local
        anesthetics block nerve conduction by inhibiting transduction of sodium, calcium, and potassium through
        voltage-gated ionotropic channels located in the cell membrane. Acute local anesthetic cardiotoxicity negatively
        impacts myocardial contractility, cardiac conduction, and systemic vascular resistance through a complex and
        widespread set of events that involve channel blockade, metabolic signaling, and intracellular energy
        production, that is, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. The clinical effects of these cellular events
        manifest initially as hypertension and tachydysrhythmias that progress to depressed cardiac conduction and
        performance (reduced cardiac output), bradycardia, and hypotension. Similarly, local anesthetic toxic effects on
        central nervous system (CNS) ionic channels manifest initially as altered mental status and/or mild prodromal
        symptoms such as paresthesias, tinnitus, and agitation and progress to seizure and possible coma.</p>
    <p>Lipid emulsion resuscitation was first proposed
        as a treatment for LAST in 1998 and translated into clinical practice 8 years later.<span>10</span>
        Over this timeframe, a number of potential mechanisms of action were proposed, the most prominent of which
        involved the hypothesis that lipid emulsion infusion effectively created an intravascular lipophilic
        <span>“</span>sink<span>” </span>into which lipid soluble local anesthetics such as
        bupivacaine partitioned and were ultimately removed from the body.<span>17</span> Twenty years
        later, lipid emulsion therapy is believed to involve multiple mechanisms that involve active shuttling of local
        anesthetic away from the heart and brain, cardiotonic effects that involve the heart and/or vasculature, and
        postconditioning cardioprotective effects.<span>10</span>
    </p>

    <h2>Shuttling Effects</h2>
    <p>Rather than acting as a static
        lipid sink, current research supports the concept that lipid emulsion works as a dynamic carrier to scavenge
        local anesthetic away from high blood flow organs that are most sensitive to LAST (ie, the heart and brain) and
        redistribute it to organs that store and detoxify the drug (ie, muscle and liver, respectively)<span>18</span>
        (Fig. 1). The precise mechanisms of local anesthetic binding to lipid droplets are not
        understood fully but are believed to combine thermodynamic effects, for example, electrostatic attraction and
        physicochemical characteristics such as lipophilicity and acid-base ionization, as positively charged,
        fat-soluble local anesthetic
        molecules bind to negatively charged lipid particles. These observations appear to support lipid emulsion having
        greater efficacy in shuttling the more lipophilic local anesthetics such as bupivacaine. Nevertheless, even the
        <i>less lipophilic </i>local anesthetics such as lidocaine or mepivacaine are highly lipid soluble and carry a
        positive charge at physiologic pH. Therefore, lipid emulsion should be effective at reversing toxicity after
        overdose with lidocaine<span>19</span> or mepivacaine. Further evidence suggests that together these
        pharmacokinetic attributes work to accelerate redistribution of local anesthetics by increasing the <span
            class="s8">α </span>half-life in whole blood, while decreasing the concentration of local anesthetic in the
        nonlipid fraction. The net effect shortens local anesthetic elimination half-life.<span>20</span><span
            class="s17">–</span><span>22</span> Lipid emulsion also has
        nonscavenging effects that manifest as cardiotonic and postconditioning effects.

        representation of mechanisms associated with lipid emulsion reversal of LAST, including shuttling of lipophilic
        local anesthetic from the heart and brain to muscle and liver. Adapted from Fettiplace et al<span
            class="s26">18</span> with permission.</p>



    <h2>Cardiotonic Effects</h2>
    <p>Several lines of evidence
        support the concept that lipid increases cardiac performance, which enhances the shuttling effect. The direct
        cardiotonic effects of lipid emulsion increase cardiac contractility, which increases cardiac output and blood
        flow through affected organs. Volume loads associated with lipid resuscitation improve cardiac function by a
        simple preload effect, although this effect is significantly less than the positive inotropy seen in both intact
        rat and isolated heart models during infusion of lipid. Lipid infusion also increases blood pressure via poorly
        understood effects on the peripheral vasculature. Together, these mechanisms serve to improve both cardiac
        output and blood pressure.<span>23,24</span></p>

    <h2>Postconditioning Effects</h2>

    <p>Recent laboratory experiments
        support the concept that adverse cellular effects of LAST overlap with mechanisms of cardiac
        ischemia-reperfusion injury.<span>25</span> Coupled with the observation that infused lipid emulsion
        activates cardioprotective pathways, this provides an additional mechanism of postconditioning benefit to the
        local
        anesthetic-toxic heart.<span>26,27</span> The explanations behind these purported benefits are
        discussed in detail in the supporting article.<span>10</span></p>

    <h2>Incidence and Epidemiology</h2>
    <p>Since publication of our 2010
        practice advisory, new evidence has furthered our understanding of LAST epidemiology. This information is
        derived from analysis of administrative databases, registries, and case reports/case series. Of particular
        importance is publication of several studies that suggest the incidence of LAST associated with
        epidural<span>28</span> and peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) is decreasing,<span>29</span> which has
        led some experts<span>29,30</span> to debate whether or not LAST remains a clinically relevant
        complication.</p>

    <h2>Administrative Databases</h2>
    <p>One avenue to assess the
        frequency of LAST in the general community population is to query large administrative databases such as the
        Premier Perspective Database (PPD).<span>31</span> As part of the current advisory series, Mörwald
        et al<span>9</span> recently presented data from over 400 hospitals on nearly 238,500 patients who
        received a PNB for total joint arthroplasty between 2006 and 2014. This methodology&#39;s weakness is that
        it
        lacks clinical details beyond those revealed by diagnostic or billing codes, and because no specific coding
        for
        LAST could be identified in the hospital reports, the methodology relies on surrogate markers such as
        seizure,
        cardiac arrest, or administration of lipid emulsion. Although the occurrence of seizure or cardiac arrest
        may
        overestimate the frequency of LAST, the increased use of lipid emulsion on the day of surgery is likely
        specific
        to the true diagnosis. In Mörwald et al&#39;s<span>9</span> study, the <i>cumulative rate </i>of
        LAST was 0.18%, that is, the rate of patients receiving a PNB and experiencing at least one LAST-associated
        outcome was 1.8/1000. During the 9-year study period, the overall adverse outcome rate trended downward
        without
        the trend reaching statistical significance, whereas the use of lipid emulsion increased significantly. The
        investigators
        concluded that, although this population-based frequency of LAST is low, it should be considered clinically
        meaningful.</p>
    <p>The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) contains a
        diagnostic code specific to LAST, although it remains uncertain how specific the coding is for LASTevents,
        because errors in coding can occur as a result of physician documentation or data abstraction. In the
        current
        practice advisory series, Rubin et al<span>12</span> report an incidence of LAST intermediate
        between that of the PPD and those of single institutions and specialized registries. Their database query of
        over 710,000 PNBs placed for total joint arthroplasties revealed an average adjusted incidence of 1.04
        (confidence interval [CI], 0.49<span>–</span>1.80) LAST events per 1000 PNBs over the 15-year period
        1998 to 2013. Of these events, 1 in 5 was
        considered major, that is, involved a seizure (8.1%) or a major cardiac complication (6.8%). Contrary to
        observations from case reports,<span>4</span> there were no deaths and multivariable analysis found
        no correlation between LAST and age or comorbidity. Total shoulder arthroplasty was associated with LAST
        more
        often than knee or hip operations (odds ratio [OR], 4.35; CI, 1.96<span>–</span>9.65), as was being
        cared for in a large to medium-sized hospital. Over the 15-year study period, and similar to Mörwald et
        al&#39;s<span>9</span> findings, the odds of a LAST event trended downward by 10% per year (OR,
        0.90; CI, 0.84<span>–</span>0.96) despite increased PNB use.</p>
    <p>The PPD&#39;s 1.8/1000 cumulative rate and the
        NIS 1.04/1000 incidence, while similar, are considerably higher than the 0.04/ 1000 to 0.8/1000 LAST
        incidences
        reported contemporaneously from various registries,<span>32</span> national surveys,<span>33</span> and
        single
        institu-tions.<span>29,34</span> Variations in the incidence
        may reflect differing definitions of LAST. For example, studies that include generalized CNS
        excitation<span>35</span> or minor cardiac complications<span>12</span> in addition to seizure and
        cardiac arrest report a higher incidence of LAST (0.87/1000 to 1.04/1000) than studies<span>29</span> that
        only
        include seizure or cardiac arrest (0.04/1000). With regard to expertise and
        caseload, PPD data suggest that LAST events within the community, where case volumes may be low and
        ultrasound
        use not universal, may be more common than those reported from registry instruments or single institutions
        that
        manifest expertise in regional anesthesia. Conversely, the NIS study found no difference between teaching
        and
        nonteaching hospitals. In summary, although administrative databases have specific weaknesses related to the
        lack of relevant clinical information on individual LAST events, they do demonstrate that LAST remains a
        rare
        yet relevant issue in the community at large.</p>

    <h2>Registries</h2>
    <p><span class="p">A
            wealth of registry and observational study data have been published since 2010. These works range from
            extensions of previously published quality assurance data sets,</span>36,37<span class="p"> national
            data-bases</span>33,38<span class="p"> and international registries,</span>35,39<span class="p"> to
            specific
            registries that focus on pediatric practice,</span>40<span class="s17">–</span>42<span class="p">
            single-center data,</span>29,32<span class="p"> and data specific to interscalene brachial plexus
            block.</span>34</p>
    <p>The most important new finding from the
        Australian and New Zealand Registry of Regional Anaesthesia (now the International Registry of Regional
        Anaesthesia) is that ultrasound guidance reduces the risk of LAST throughout its continuum by 60% to 65%
        (propensity analysis OR, 0.35<span>–</span>0.36) as compared with peripheral nerve stimulation
        alone.<span>35</span> This observation is supported by the Dartmouth registry, which reported only 1
        seizure in 12,668 ultrasound-guided blocks.<span>32</span> The International Registry of Regional
        Anaesthesia registry also reported a surprisingly higher risk of LAST with lidocaine than with ropivacaine,
        which the authors speculated may reflect a practitioner&#39;s false sense of security when using relatively
        less
        toxic lidocaine.<span>35</span></p>
    <p>National survey data from
        Italy<span>38</span> reveal an incidence of LAST during PNB of 0.34/1000 blocks, and Finnish
        data<span>33</span> document a similar 0.37 per 1000 PNBs. Of note, the Finnish incidence is lower
        if all LAST events (including epidural, but not spinal, anesthetics) are included (0.07 per 1000). This
        observation is consistent with previous knowledge that LAST is 4 to 5 times more common with PNBs than with
        epidurals.<span>1</span> If one were to combine LAST events reported since 2010 from 11 registries
        and observational studies, the population frequency is 0.27/1000 (95% CI, 0.21<span>–</span>0.35)
        (69 events per 251,325 PNBs).<span>11</span></p>
    <p>Data from observational studies offer some
        insights into whether or not experience and expertise affect the rate of LAST. The Finnish
        study<span>33</span>
        noted a 3.3 relative risk of having a LAST event in a nonuniversity hospital as
        compared with a university hospital. Similarly, the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, which
        represents a
        specialized high-volume regional anesthesia practice, reported 0.04 seizures per 1000 blocks, which is lower
        than other reports and may not apply to the community at large.<span>29</span></p>
    <p>Pediatric anesthetics captured in
        registries<span>40,42</span> and single-center<span>41</span> observational studies
        confirm a very low overall rate of LAST in children. Data from the 2012 Pediatric Regional Anesthesia
        Network
        documented no LAST episodes in 14,917 proce-dures,<span>42</span> although its most recent analysis
        of over 100,000 regional anesthetics will report 7 severe LAST episodes (cardiac arrest or
        seizure)<span>—</span>0.076/1000, 95% CI, 0.029 to 0.14/1000 (J.M. Neal,</p>
    <p>MD, and D.M. Polaner, MD, personal written
        communication September 19, 2017). The French-Language Society of Pediatric Anaesthesiologists&#39;
        registry<span>40</span> reported rates of 0.16/1000 for PNBs and 1.3/1000 neuraxial blocks
        (excluding spinal anesthesia). The frequency of LAST associated with pediatric continuous catheter
        techniques is
        higher, 1.53 per 1000.<span>41</span> When compared with the overall population frequency of
        0.27/1000 (95% CI, 0.21<span>–</span>0.35),<span>11</span> it can be argued that the
        rate of LAST in pediatric populations is less than that in adults. This in part may be because most regional
        anesthesia in children is performed under general anesthesia (which raises seizure threshold) using smaller
        local anesthetic volumes, and children likely have a lower comorbidity burden.</p>
    <p>In summary, clinical registries have the
        capability of identifying infrequent events that occur in large populations, but often at the expense of
        detailed analysis. Of recent events that were reported in sufficient detail, 72% were considered major: 42
        seizures and 8 cardiovascular (CV) presentations.<span>11</span> Expectedly, minor events are less
        likely to be reported at all. These data support the assertion that LAST, while rare, remains a serious
        complication of local anesthetic use. Ultrasound guidance reduces the likelihood of any LAST event, yet
        seizure
        and/or cardiac arrest still occur at an estimated rate of 0.26/1000 ultrasound-guided blocks.<span>43</span>
    </p>

    <h2>Case Reports and Series</h2>
    <p>Voluminous case reports
        published over the past decade emphasize the need to educate anesthesiologists and especially
        nonanesthesiologists in the prevention, recognition, and treatment of LAST. Case reports and case series
        allow
        in-depth analysis of individual incidents of LAST, but without the ability to gain insight into
        population-based
        frequency. The power of case report analysis is the ability to discern patient comorbidities, technique
        details,
        and treatment effectiveness, together with the ability to appreciate evolving trends in LAST presentation.
        The
        latter is important in assessing the impact of newer local anesthetic agents, nerve localization techniques
        (ultrasound guidance), and/or treatment modalities such as lipid emulsion therapy. Insights from case report
        analysis will be presented in Recognition section.</p>


    <p>In summarizing knowledge
        related to the incidence or frequency of LAST, we wish to emphasize that regardless of reporting mechanism,
        administrative data, registries, or case reports, the true frequency of LAST in the anesthesiology community
        is
        very likely underreported. This stems from a number of factors including misdiagnosis, publication bias, and
        individual practitioner underreporting, especially because it relates to nonanesthesiologists. The panel
        opines
        that, even if the rates of LAST are decreasing, the complication should not be trivialized. When placed into
        the
        perspective of other rare anesthetic complications, serious LAST occurs more frequently than epidural
        hematoma
        and at least as often as peripheral nerve injury, and is unique to both in its potential for mortality.</p>

    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <p>Prevention is the primary and
        preferred mechanism for reducing the frequency and severity of LAST; meticulous attention to detail is the
        most
        important aspect of prevention. Optimal prevention is a multifactorial process, because no single
        intervention
        eliminates risk. Prevention involves 3 facets: avoidance and/or recognition of direct intravascular
        injection of
        local anesthetic, mitigating systemic uptake of local anesthetic from soft tissues, and awareness of
        patients at
        increased risk for LAST. The latter topic will be discussed in Recognition section.</p>

    <h2>Limiting Local Anesthetic Uptake </h2>
    <p>Table 2 reviews key prevention
        strategies. Avoidance of intravascular injection is best accomplished by ultrasound guidance, judicious use
        of
        an intravascular marker, and incremental injection of local anesthetic through needles and catheters based
        on an
        appropriate circulation time between injections (longer for lower extremity blocks and at-risk
        patients, such as those with slower circulation). Systemic uptake of local anesthetic is best mitigated by
        awareness of those regional techniques most associated with delayed systemic uptake, by prolonging drug
        clearance through the use of epinephrine,<span>44</span> and by using the lowest effective local
        anesthetic dose, which can be facilitated by low volume ultrasound-guided techniques.<span>43</span>
        The panel wishes to emphasize awareness that local anesthetic toxicity is additive<span>—</span>whether by
        subsequent redosing of the same or a different local anesthetic and whether
        administration of the drug is by the same or a different member of the perioperative team. The latter
        scenario
        may occur when anesthesiologist and surgeon both administer local anesthetic during the care of a patient.
    </p>

    <h2>LAST and the
        Newer
        Regional Anesthetic Techniques</h2>
    <p>New regional anesthetic
        techniques have expanded into anes-thesiologists&#39; practice. These include a variety of fascial
        plane-based
        truncal blocks, local infiltration anesthesia (LIA), and extended release liposomal bupivacaine (LB).
        Published
        information on these topics is limited, which impacts the panel&#39;s ability to offer definitive
        recommendations.</p>
    <p>Within the anesthesiology community, the largest
        growth in new techniques involves truncal blocks that target fascial planes (eg, transversus abdominis
        plane,
        rectus sheath, quadratus lumborum, pectoral blocks).<span>45</span> Within the surgical community,
        LIA has expanded, particularly in total joint arthroplasty practice. Case reports document LAST occurrences
        in
        both truncal block<span>46</span> and LIA<span>47</span> patients. The former may be at
        particularly high risk for LAST because targeted tissue planes are very vascular, local anesthetic volumes
        are
        high, and the blocks are often used in at-risk patient populations, that
        is,
        children and parturients. The advisory panel agrees with the recommendations put forth by Chin et
        al<span>48</span> in their recent review of abdominal wall blocks. Their recommended strategies to
        reduce the likelihood of LAST include using epinephrine to reduce local anesthetic
        bioavailability,<span>49</span> using dilute concentrations of less cardiotoxic local anesthetics, basing
        dose
        calculations on lean body weight, and 30- to 45-minute monitoring periods to account for the prolonged time
        to
        local anesthetic peak plasma concentration that is inherent to truncal blocks.<span>48</span> (IIa;

        retrospective review of 6 published RCTs of LB use for 335 PNBs reported no incident of identifiable LAST.
        Incidents of dose-related bradycardia (2%<span>–</span>14%) were conceivably consistent with limited
        LAST, but by no means diagnostic. To our knowledge, there are no published case reports of LAST associated
        with
        LB (possibly indicating negative reporting bias for adverse events); however, 130 cases (January 2012 to
        June
        2016) are present in the US Food and Drug Administration&#39;s (FDA&#39;s) Adverse Event Reporting System.
        This
        voluntary self-reporting system, which does not have a code specific to LAST, is non<span>–</span>peer
        reviewed
        and is open to reports from medical professionals, industry, and private
        individuals. Using the statistical technique of disproportionality analysis, Aggarwal<span>51</span>
        reports an association between LB and LAST based on the FDA&#39;s Adverse Event Reporting System data.</p>
    <p>The corpus of published human studies on LB
        totals only a few thousand patients, the drug has been clinically available in the United States for only 5
        years, and the pharmacologic and chemical dynamics of liposomal formulations are dramatically different from
        standard local anesthetics. Based on such limited information, our recommendation is that patients receiving
        LB
        be afforded the same level of vigilance as would be given to any patient receiving a local anesthetic (IIb;
        C).

    <h2>Prevention Strategies</h2>
    <p>In the interval since our
        second practice advisory, 2 new findings related to prevention deserve emphasis. First is the evolving role
        of
        ultrasound guidance. Meta-analysis had shown that ultrasound reduced the incidence of vascular puncture
        associated with PNB compared with peripheral nerve stimulation,<span>52</span> yet previous
        institutional<span>32,36</span> and registry<span>39</span> data did not link this
        surrogate outcome to a definitive reduction in seizure or cardiac arrest. In the intervening years,
        Barrington
        and Kluger<span>35</span> have confirmed that ultrasound guidance reduces the incidence of
        LASTepisodes spanning the continuum from mild subjective symptoms of toxicity to seizure and cardiac arrest.
        As
        compared with landmark techniques, ultrasound reduced the risk of LAST by 65% in their study of over 25,000
        PNBs. These findings are consistent with those reported by Orebaugh et al.<span>37</span> The second
        new finding related to prevention involves the changing patterns of LAST presentation, as discussed below.
    </p>

    <h2>Recognition: The
        Changing Patterns of LAST Presentation</h2>
    <p>Our 2010 advisory was
        accompanied by DiGregorio et al&#39;s<span>4</span> analysis of 93 LAST cases reported over the
        30-year period, 1979 to 2009.<span>4</span> In the interim, Vasques et al<span>53</span>
        presented 67 additional cases from 2010 to March 2014. Accompanying the current advisory, Gitman and
        Barrington<span>11</span> present 47 more cases reported between April 2014 and November 2016. These
        case series span nearly 4 decades and serve to confirm some expected patterns of LAST clinical presentation
        while revealing changing patterns in others. First, all 3 case series reinforce the concept that LAST events are
        skewed toward the
        extremes of age. The recent finding that large amounts of absorbed local anesthetic are stored in skeletal
        muscle suggests that patients with low muscle mass are at higher risk for LAST. The most recent Pediatric
        Regional Anesthesia Network data confirm similar observations in infants under 6 months old, whose rate of
        serious LAST is 6-fold higher than that for other children (J.M. Neal, MD, and D.M. Polaner, MD, personal
        written communication on September 19, 2017). In addition to lower muscle mass, infants and neonates
        manifest a
        higher unbound fraction of local anesthetic. Second, although bupivacaine is the most toxic local anesthetic
        and
        the most difficult overdose to resuscitate when LAST occurs, all local anesthetics are capable of causing
        toxicity, including <span>“</span>safer<span>” </span>agents such as lidocaine and
        ropivacaine (26% and 21%, respectively, of total events in the latest case series).<span>11</span>
        The advisory panel and others<span>35,54</span> speculate that practitioners may be less vigilant
        with regard to dosing and safety steps when administering these purportedly less toxic local anesthetics.
        Furthermore, the panel opines that, when viewed on an equipotent basis, ropivacaine as administered in most
        clinical settings is likely similar in toxicity to bupivacaine. Third, about 15% of LAST events involve
        continuous local anesthetic infusions and most episodes present 1 to 4 days after initiation of the
        infusion,
        often with subtle prodromes or hemodynamic changes.</p>
    <p>The combined case series<span>4,11,53</span>
        also reveal shifting patterns in LAST&#39;s clinical presentation. First, an
        increasing number of events (about 20%) occur outside of the traditional hospital environment and half
        involve a
        nonanesthesiologist. The occurrence of LAST after simple tissue infiltration of local anesthetic in 20% of
        events is consistent with nonanesthesia-trained practitioners administering the drug and/or an increase in
        LIA
        techniques. Similar events involve topical anesthesia of the airway or transcutaneous absorption of local
        anesthetics. Second, a new signal from the current case series<span>11</span> involves a
        preponderance of pediatric LAST events associated with penile block, which accounted for a quarter of case
        reports during that series&#39; 2.5-year period. Some of these cases required chest
        compression.<span>55</span>
        Encouragingly, after implementing policy, dosing, and technique changes, the involved
        institution reports no further LASTevents associated with penile block (G. Weinberg, MD and R. Yu, MD,
        personal
        verbal communication May 2017).</p>
    <p>The 2010 practice advisory noted that 40% of
        reported cases did not present in a manner consistent with the classic textbook description of LAST. Rather
        than
        an initial complex of CNS excitement, for example, metallic taste or auditory changes, followed by seizure
        and
        then CV collapse, nearly half of the presentations were considered <span>“</span>atypical,<span>”
        </span>presenting with CV signs alone (no evidence of CNS toxicity) and/or having a delayed
        presentation (more than 5 minutes after injection of local anesthetic). Although the occurrence rates vary
        slightly, the interim analyses from 2010 to 2016<span>11,53</span> conform to previous observations
        that about one third of patients present with combined CNS/CV signs and symptoms (mostly seizures,
        hypertension
        or hypotension, and electrocardiographic changes). Fewer patients exhibit isolated CV symptoms as compared
        with
        isolated CNS symptoms (Figs. 2, 3). Another change to clinical presentation is a shift in timing from signs
        and
        symptoms appearing coincident with or within a minute of local anesthetic administration (intravascular
        injection) to presentations that are delayed from several minutes to 30 or even 60 minutes after
        injection<span>11,53</span> (Fig. 4). We speculate that this shift toward delayed presentation involves
        fewer
        intravascular injections as a consequence of ultrasound guidance, the increasing use of local tissue
        infiltration techniques, and/or increasing use of continuous local anesthetic infusion. This shift
        strengthens
        our previous advice to observe patients for at least 30 minutes after injecting potentially toxic doses of
        local
        anesthetic.</p>

    <p>Despite changing patterns in LAST presentation,
        our recommendations remain consistent. Local anesthetic systemic toxicity is a masquerader, and its
        detection
        requires persistent open-minded vigilance. To emphasize reasonable local anesthetic dosing and to highlight
        those patients most at risk for LAST, we recommend including a discussion of local anesthetic use during the
        preincisional surgical pause. Doing so facilitates awareness among all perioperative</p>

    <p>Team members of maximal local anesthetic
        dosing
        and the issue of additive toxicity, particularly because it pertains to local anesthetic administration by
        different team members, including nonanesthesiologists. The surgical pause is also an opportunity to
        highlight
        at-risk patients and how they might present with LAST. Classic presentation patterns that involve subjective
        signs, seizure, or cardiac arrest in close proximity to local anesthetic dosing do not always occur. When
        patients receive a local anesthetic and manifest a delayed presentation of agitation or CNS depression, or
        unexplained signs of cardiac compromise such as progressive hypotension or bradycardia, LAST should be
        considered in the differential diagnosis. Table 3 outlines factors believed to heighten the risk of LAST.

        4 reviews recommendations for diagnosing LAST.</p>

    <h2>Treatment: Evolving Paradigms</h2>
    <p>The treatment of severe LAST is
        fundamentally different from conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) insofar as toxic
        cardiomyopathy
        differs pathophysiologically from other causes of CV collapse. First, unlike contemporary CPR paradigms that
        eschew early respiratory interventions in favor of cardiac support, successful treatment of LAST hinges on
        the
        primacy of airway management to prevent the hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis that potentiate LAST and
        negatively impact resusci-tative efforts. The mechanism of potentiation may be related to increased free
        fraction of local anesthetic and/or worsening of cardiac function. Second, while CPR and Advanced Cardiac
        Life
        Support (ACLS) symptomatically treat hemodynamic perturbations consequent to ischemic cardiac injury,
        usually
        with the goal of improving coronary perfusion, successful treatment of LAST seeks to effectively moderate or
        reverse the mechanisms underlying the local anesthetic toxicity. Recent evidence indicates that the
        inotropic
        benefit of lipid only occurs when myocardial local anesthetic content is reduced below a threshold that
        corresponds to ion channel blocking concentrations. This underlines the importance of effective CPR to
        ensure
        that coronary perfusion is sufficient to reduce local anesthetic tissue levels to attain the maximum benefit
        of
        lipid infusion. Third, recent data from rat models reinforce the admonition that epinephrine, when
        necessary, be
        administered initially in small doses (1 <span class="s8">μ</span>g/kg or less) to avoid impaired pulmonary
        gas
        exchange<span>56</span> and increased afterload. Fourth, simulated LAST scenarios
        have demonstrated the usefulness of the ASRA Checklist<span>57</span> as a cognitive
        aid during LAST treatment<span>58</span> and the value of a reader to prompt
        adherence to recommendations.<span>59</span> An updated version of the ASRA
        Checklist is part of this practice advisory series.<span>13</span> The ASRA LAST
        smart phone app (iOS and Android) has been updated coincident with this practice advisory.

    <h2>Insights Regarding Contemporary LAST Treatment</h2>
    <p>The case
        report
        analysis presented with this practice advi-sory<span>11</span> allows insights into
        the contemporary treatment of LAST.</p>
    <p>Treatment
        protocols developed by national organizations such as ASRA<span>57</span> and the
        Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland<span>60</span> are
        followed inconsistently. Less than half (47%) of patients with LASTwere treated with lipid
        emulsion, and nearly 40% of those patients received the antidote 10 minutes or longer after
        symptom onset, occasionally at an incorrect dose. Nevertheless, and within the limits of
        case
        series comparison, the overall use of lipid emulsion has apparently increased from 34% to
        47% as
        compared with our 2010 report.<span>4</span> An ACLS was necessary in 21% of
        patients; duration ranged from 2 to 60 minutes. Two of the reported 47 patients died; one
        from a
        combination of delayed diagnosis and treatment, and the other self-administered over 4 g

    <p>These
        recommendations are intended to encourage optimal patient care but cannot ensure the avoidance of
        adverse outcomes. As with any practice advisory recommendation, these are subject to revision as
        knowledge advances regarding specific complications.</p>
    <hr>



    <h2>New Treatment Recommendations </h2>
    <p>The use of lipid
        emulsion as an antidote for LAST is <span>“</span>off label,<span>” </span>as
        defined by the FDA. Our 2010 advisory suggested using lipid emulsion therapy at the first sign of
        arrhythmia, prolonged seizures, or rapid clinical deterioration of the patient. Based on evidence
        that
        lipid shuttling is most effective early in the toxic event<span>10</span> when local
        anesthetic plasma concentrations are at their peak, we now unequivocally recommend lipid emulsion
        therapy soon after airway management in any LAST event that is judged to be potentially serious.
        Furthermore, because adverse effects from lipid administration specifically as an antidote for LAST
        appear to be minor and limited, we recommend erring on the early side of administration. The maximum
        lipid dose has been increased to ~12
        mL/kg based on FDA recommendations.<span>61</span> Nevertheless, total lipid doses used in
        resuscitation of LAST are usually much less (typically about half ) of this limit. Thus, it is
        important
        to avoid delivering an excessive dose of lipid since dangerous fat overload can
        occur.<span>62</span>
        Table 5 outlines treatment recommendations.</p>



    <h2>Future Directions</h2>
    <p>If the previous decade
        is any indication, we expect continued progress in our understanding of LAST<span>—</span>its
        incidence,
        cellular mechanisms, prevention, and treatment. Much work remains
        with regard to understanding the cellular and systemic mechanisms inherent to local anesthetic
        poisoning. Advancement of this knowledge holds promise for improved resuscitation. Whether or not
        the
        overall incidence of LAST is truly diminishing remains open to debate, particularly because it
        pertains
        to the healthcare community at large, in nonhospital settings, and among nonanesthesiologist
        practitioners. Hopefully the future will see further development of local anesthetic alternatives
        such
        as neosaxitoxin, which blocks sensory conduction by
        binding to
        the external pores of noncardiac sodium channels and does not cross the blood-brain barrier.<span>63</span>
        Neosaxitoxin thus prolongs anesthesia without the risk of local anesthetic-induced
        cardio- and CNS toxicity. Until such time as alternative drugs come into use, the burden is on
        anesthesiologists
        and LAST researchers to improve our knowledge of basic mechanisms, enhance early recognition, improve
        awareness,
        and build effective systems for prevention and treatment.</p>
    <p>To reiterate our concluding comments from the
        2010 practice advisory, <span>“</span>LAST remains a significant clinical problem. Considering 1)
        the extensive use of local anesthetics, 2) the frequent use of doses sufficient to cause significant
        morbidity
        or mortality, and 3) the imperfect nature of our ability to predict, prevent, detect, and treat these
        complications, it remains the responsibility of all clinicians using local anesthetics to understand their
        potential for causing severe systemic toxicity and to be prepared to respond immediately when these events
        occur.<span>”</span><span>1</span> Moreover, subtle or undetected patient comorbidities
        can significantly increase susceptibility to LAST. Practice patterns and system improvements may well reduce
        the
        likelihood of LAST and optimize patient safety. Nevertheless, although we contend that the frequency of LAST
        can
        be reduced, it is unlikely to be eliminated altogether<span>—</span>there will always be system
        errors, unrecognized patient comorbidities, and stochastic events that invariably arise in large
        populations.
        Although LAST is indeed a rare event, it still occurs despite proper technique used by competent
        professionals.
        When LAST happens, recognition and preparedness make it a treatable complication of regional anesthesia.</p>
